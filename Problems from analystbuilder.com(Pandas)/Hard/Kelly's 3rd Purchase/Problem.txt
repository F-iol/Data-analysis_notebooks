At Kelly's Ice Cream Shop, Kelly gives a 33% discount on each customer's 3rd purchase.

Write a query to select the 3rd transaction for each customer that received that discount. Output the customer id, transaction id, amount, and the amount after the discount as "discounted_amount".

Order output on customer ID in ascending order.

Note: Transaction IDs occur sequentially. The lowest transaction ID is the earliest ID.
