If our company hits its yearly targets, every employee receives a salary increase depending on what level you are in the company.

Give each Employee who is a level 1 a 10% increase, level 2 a 15% increase, and level 3 a 200% increase.

Include this new column in your output as "new_salary" along with your other columns.
