The question asks you to calculate two percentages based on search results. First, find the percentage of all search records clicked (clicked = 1) and in the top 3 positions. Second, find the percentage of all search records that were not clicked (clicked = 0) but in the top 3 positions. Both percentages are calculated with respect to the total number of search records and should be output in the same row as two columns.
